# Context

The reusable workflow `.github/workflows/add-to-project.yml` adds issues and PRs
to an org-level GitHub Project. It currently requires a `github-token` secret
that must be a Personal Access Token (PAT). The built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` will not
work because it is scoped to the triggering repository and cannot access
org-level Projects.

PAT-based authentication creates operational friction:

- PATs are tied to a specific user. If that user leaves or rotates the token,
  every repo calling this workflow must update its secret.
- A PAT makes all project modifications appear to come from the token owner,
  not from the automation itself.
- PATs require periodic manual rotation. Fine-grained PATs expire after one year.

A GitHub App installation token solves all three: it is org-scoped, identifies
itself as the app, and requires no periodic rotation (installation tokens are
short-lived and minted per-workflow-run).

## Scope

This ADR documents the authentication approach. The implementation plan
(`2026-05-02-github-app-add-to-project.md`) details the steps. This ADR covers
the design decision; the plan covers execution.

# Decision

The reusable workflow generates a GitHub App installation token itself using
`actions/create-github-app-token@v2` so callers only need to pass `app-id` and
`private-key` secrets. The token is then passed to
`actions/add-to-project` like any other token.

This keeps the complexity in one place (the reusable workflow) and gives callers
a simple `secrets:` block to wire up.

## Caller workflow

```yaml
jobs:
  add-to-project:
    uses: jmmaloney4/sector7/.github/workflows/add-to-project.yml@main
    secrets:
      app-id: ${{ secrets.SECTOR7_PROJECT_BOT_APP_ID }}
      private-key: ${{ secrets.SECTOR7_PROJECT_BOT_PRIVATE_KEY }}
```

## Reusable workflow (target state)

```yaml
on:
  workflow_call:
    inputs:
      runs-on:
        default: 'self-hosted'
        type: string
      project_url:
        default: 'https://github.com/orgs/ergodicsystems/projects/1'
        type: string
      labeled:
        default: ''
        type: string
      label-operator:
        default: OR
        type: string
    secrets:
      app-id:
        required: false
      private-key:
        required: false
      github-token:
        description: Fallback PAT secret (legacy)
        required: false

permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  add-to-project:
    runs-on: ${{ inputs.runs-on }}
    steps:
      - name: Generate GitHub App token
        id: gen_token
        if: inputs.app-id != '' && inputs.private-key != ''
        uses: actions/create-github-app-token@v2
        with:
          app-id: ${{ inputs.app-id }}
          private-key: ${{ inputs.private-key }}

      - name: Set fallback token
        id: fallback
        if: inputs.app-id == '' || inputs.private-key == ''
        run: echo "token=${{ secrets.github-token }}" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"
        shell: bash

      - name: Use app token or fallback
        id: token
        if: inputs.app-id != '' && inputs.private-key != ''
        run: echo "token=${{ steps.gen_token.outputs.token }}" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"
        shell: bash

      - name: Add issue or PR to project (no label filter)
        if: inputs.labeled == ''
        uses: actions/add-to-project@244f685bbc3b7adfa8466e08b698b5577571133e
        with:
          project-url: ${{ inputs.project_url }}
          github-token: ${{ steps.token.outputs.token }}

      - name: Add issue or PR to project (label filter)
        if: inputs.labeled != ''
        uses: actions/add-to-project@244f685bbc3b7adfa8466e08b698b5577571133e
        with:
          project-url: ${{ inputs.project_url }}
          github-token: ${{ steps.token.outputs.token }}
          labeled: ${{ inputs.labeled }}
          label-operator: ${{ inputs.label-operator }}
```

## GitHub App registration

The app should be registered in the target org with these settings:

| Field                                 | Value                 |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Name                                  | `sector7-project-bot` |
| Permissions → Organization → Projects | Read and write        |
| Permissions → Repository → Metadata   | Read-only             |
| Webhook                               | Active: unchecked     |

The app only needs an org-level installation -- it does not need to be installed
on individual consumer repos. Its permission to touch org projects comes from the
org installation itself.

## Required secrets

The app ID and private key should be stored as **organization secrets** on the
target org (preferred), so all consumer repos reference the same credential:

| Secret                            | Value             |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `SECTOR7_PROJECT_BOT_APP_ID`      | App ID (integer)  |
| `SECTOR7_PROJECT_BOT_PRIVATE_KEY` | Full PEM contents |

For repos outside the org, store as repository secrets instead.

# Consequences

## Positive

- No PAT tied to a user identity. App identity survives personnel changes.
- Project modifications are attributed to the app, not an individual.
- No manual token rotation -- installation tokens are minted per run and expire
  after one hour.
- Finer-grained scoping: the app can be limited to org projects.
- Callers have a simple interface: two secrets, no token generation logic.

## Negative

- Requires creating and configuring a GitHub App at the org level.
- The reusable workflow now has an additional step and conditional logic.
- Private key storage in secrets must be rotated if compromised.
- Does not work for user-level projects.

# Alternatives

- **PAT (current approach)**: Simplest to set up, but ties automation to a user,
  requires manual rotation, and attributes changes to the token owner.
- **Token generation in caller workflow**: Puts the token minting step in every
  caller instead of the reusable workflow. This works (see issue #158 workarounds)
  but replicates the same two steps across all six consumer repos. Chose to
  centralize instead.
- **actions/create-github-app-token vs tibdex/github-app-token**: The official
  action (`actions/create-github-app-token@v2`) is preferred over `tibdex` because
  it is maintained by GitHub, supports configurable permissions out of the box,
  and requires no pinned SHA -- the action version is the pin.

# Security / Privacy / Compliance

- The `private-key` secret contains a private RSA key. Store as an org-level
  secret. Do not log or echo it.
- Installation tokens expire after one hour, limiting blast radius if leaked.
- The official `actions/create-github-app-token` action is pinned by version tag
  in the caller, not by SHA -- this is the recommended pinning method for this
  action (see its README for security guidance).
- Review which repos have the app installed. The app's token grants permissions
  across the org's projects regardless of which repo triggers it.

# Operational Notes

- When creating the GitHub App, generate a private key immediately and store it
  in the org-level secrets. The key is shown only once during creation.
- The app does not need a webhook URL or public endpoint -- it is used solely
  for token generation.
- If the private key is rotated, update the org-level secrets before the old key
  expires. All repos reference the same secret name, so this is a single update.
- The app's org project permissions take effect immediately -- no re-installation
  needed after changing permissions in the app settings.

# Status Transitions

None.

# Implementation Notes

The implementation plan is at
`docs/internal/plans/2026-05-02-github-app-add-to-project.md`. It covers:

1. Register the GitHub App in the org.
2. Store credentials as org-level secrets.
3. Update the reusable workflow to generate tokens internally.
4. Update caller workflows in all six consumer repos.
5. Verify end-to-end.
